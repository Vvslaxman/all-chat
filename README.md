# all-chat
The error message you're encountering is related to a connection issue with SQL Server. Specifically, the error **"No process is on the other end of the pipe"** indicates that while the connection to the SQL Server instance was established, the login process failed due to a communication breakdown.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this:

### 1. **Check SQL Server Configuration**
   - Ensure that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. You can check this in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
     - Right-click the server instance > Properties > Connections > Check "Allow remote connections to this server."
   - Also, check the SQL Server instance is running in the correct mode (mixed mode authentication if you're using SQL Server authentication).

### 2. **Check Network Protocols**
   - Verify that the **Shared Memory** protocol is enabled on SQL Server.
     - Open SQL Server Configuration Manager.
     - Under **SQL Server Network Configuration** > **Protocols for SQLEXPRESS**, check if "Shared Memory" is enabled. If it’s disabled, enable it and restart the SQL Server instance.

### 3. **Check the Firewall**
   - Ensure that the firewall on the SQL Server machine isn't blocking the connection.
   - Make sure the port SQL Server uses (default is **1433**) is open in both the Windows firewall and any network firewalls.

### 4. **Check the SQL Server Logs**
   - Check the SQL Server error logs for any additional information about why the connection is failing. You can find these logs in:
     - **Program Files > Microsoft SQL Server > MSSQL<version_number>.MSSQLSERVER > LOG**.

### 5. **Review SQL Server Authentication**
   - The error can also occur if the authentication method isn't set up correctly. Check that SQL Server is configured to use either Windows authentication or SQL Server authentication depending on your setup.

### 6. **Restart SQL Server Services**
   - Sometimes, simply restarting the SQL Server services can resolve connection issues.
     - Go to **Services** in Windows, find **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)**, and restart it.

### 7. **Try Connecting Locally**
   - If you're trying to connect remotely, try connecting to the SQL Server instance locally using `localhost\SQLEXPRESS` to see if the issue is specific to remote connections.

If none of these work, you may want to investigate whether there are other issues with your SQL Server installation or network environment that could be causing the issue. If you'd like to dive deeper into any of these steps, let me know!


It seems like there are two main issues here:

1. **The Ping Test Fails** (Request Timed Out)
2. **Telnet Command Not Found** (Not Recognized as a Valid Command)

Let’s address each of these separately to help you troubleshoot the connection to your SQL Server.

### 1. **Ping Test (Request Timed Out)**

The fact that the ping command is timing out indicates that there is a network-level issue preventing communication with the SQL VM. This could be due to one or more of the following reasons:

#### a. **VM Firewall Configuration**
   - Even though you’ve configured the Windows Defender firewall to allow port 1433, it might still be blocking ICMP (ping) traffic.
   - **Fix:** To allow ping responses, you can explicitly enable **ICMP (ping) requests** in your Windows firewall.
     - Open **Windows Firewall** and create a new inbound rule:
       - **Type**: Custom
       - **Protocol and Ports**: ICMPv4 (or any protocol you want to allow, but ICMP is specifically for ping)
       - **Action**: Allow the connection
       - **Profile**: Choose Private, Public, or All profiles as needed

#### b. **Network Security Group (NSG)**
   - Even though you added a rule for port 1433 in the NSG, ICMP might be blocked. Ensure you have an inbound rule in the NSG that allows ICMP traffic (for pinging).
     - In the NSG, you would need to add a rule for **ICMP**:
       - **Source**: Any or your client IP range
       - **Destination**: Virtual Network or IP
       - **Protocol**: ICMP
       - **Action**: Allow
       - **Priority**: (Make sure this has a higher priority than any deny rules)

#### c. **Network Connectivity**
   - Double-check that the VM is connected to the correct virtual network and subnet. You can verify this via the **Network Interfaces** in the Azure portal.

#### d. **Route Tables and Peering**
   - If your VM is in a different subnet or a peered network, check the **route tables** and **virtual network peering** to ensure that traffic is routed correctly between the subnets.

#### e. **Azure VM Instance Settings**
   - Ensure the **NIC (Network Interface Card)** on the VM has the correct IP and is configured to accept the necessary traffic. Sometimes, an incorrectly configured NIC could also lead to unreachable hosts.

### 2. **Telnet Command Not Recognized**

The `telnet` command is not recognized because it is not enabled by default in some versions of Windows. You’ll need to install it manually if you want to use it for troubleshooting.

#### **Enable Telnet in Windows:**
To use the `telnet` command, you need to enable it through the Control Panel:
1. Open **Control Panel** and go to **Programs** > **Turn Windows features on or off**.
2. Scroll down and check **Telnet Client**.
3. Click **OK**.

Alternatively, you can install it via PowerShell:
```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName TelnetClient
```

Once enabled, you can use `telnet` to test port connectivity:
```bash
telnet 10.0.1.4 1433
```
This will let you know if the SQL Server port (1433) is reachable. If it connects, that means your SQL Server port is open; if it fails, the port is blocked at some point.

### 3. **Check SQL Server Accessibility**
After addressing the ping and telnet issues, ensure your SQL Server is properly listening on port 1433 and accessible from your client machine.

- **Check SQL Server’s Listening Port:**
  - Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** on the SQL Server VM.
  - Under **SQL Server Network Configuration** > **Protocols for SQLEXPRESS**, ensure that **TCP/IP** is enabled.
  - Make sure that SQL Server is listening on port **1433**.

- **Check SQL Server Firewall Settings**:
  - Confirm that SQL Server is allowed to accept connections on TCP 1433. You’ve already added the rule in Windows Firewall, but double-check that SQL Server is actually using that port.

### 4. **Test Using PowerShell (Instead of Ping)**

If `ping` is disabled (or you're using a different cloud service that blocks ICMP), you can use **PowerShell** to test connectivity to port 1433:
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.0.1.4 -Port 1433
```
This will check if port 1433 is open on the SQL VM.

---

### Recap:
1. Ensure **ICMP (ping)** traffic is allowed on the SQL Server VM firewall and NSG.
2. Enable **Telnet Client** to test connectivity via port 1433.
3. Verify SQL Server is correctly configured to listen on port 1433.
4. Use **PowerShell** to check connectivity to port 1433 if ping is not available.

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, let me know and I can help you with more detailed troubleshooting!

Yes, you are correct. Based on your problem statement, you need to connect to the **SQL Server** instance on the **SQL-VM** using the **private IP address** (10.0.1.4) from your **APP-IIS-VM** in the **private subnet**.

The error you're seeing suggests that there is a **network-related or instance-specific issue** when trying to connect to SQL Server. This could be caused by a number of issues, such as network connectivity, SQL Server configuration, or firewall/NSG settings.

Let’s go step-by-step to resolve the problem:

---

### **1. Verify SQL Server Configuration on SQL-VM (Private Subnet)**

#### a. **Ensure SQL Server Allows Remote Connections**
1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio** (SSMS) directly on the **SQL-VM**.
2. Right-click on the **SQL Server instance** (e.g., `SQLEXPRESS`) in **Object Explorer** and select **Properties**.
3. Go to the **Connections** page and make sure **Allow remote connections to this server** is checked.

#### b. **Enable TCP/IP Protocol on SQL Server**
1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** on **SQL-VM**.
2. Under **SQL Server Network Configuration**, click on **Protocols for SQLEXPRESS** (or your SQL Server instance name).
3. Ensure **TCP/IP** is enabled. If not, right-click and select **Enable**.
4. After enabling **TCP/IP**, restart the **SQL Server** instance:
   - In **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, go to **SQL Server Services**, right-click on **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)**, and select **Restart**.

#### c. **Check SQL Server Instance Listening on Port 1433**
1. In **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, under **SQL Server Network Configuration** > **Protocols for SQLEXPRESS**, right-click on **TCP/IP** and select **Properties**.
2. Under **IP Addresses**, ensure that **TCP Dynamic Ports** is blank and **TCP Port** is set to **1433** (for the default instance).

---

### **2. Verify Windows Firewall on SQL-VM (Private Subnet)**

Make sure the **Windows Firewall** on **SQL-VM** is correctly configured to allow inbound connections to port **1433** for SQL Server.

1. **Create an Inbound Rule for SQL Server Port 1433**:
   - Open **Windows Defender Firewall** (type `wf.msc` in the Run box).
   - Go to **Inbound Rules** > **New Rule**.
   - Select **Port** and click **Next**.
   - Choose **TCP** and specify **Port 1433**.
   - Select **Allow the connection**.
   - Ensure **Domain**, **Private**, and **Public** profiles are selected (typically select all unless you have specific requirements).
   - Name the rule (e.g., `Allow SQL Server 1433`).

2. **Allow Ping (Optional, for Troubleshooting)**:
   - If you'd like to use ping for connectivity testing, create a rule in the firewall to allow **ICMP**:
     - In **Inbound Rules**, select **New Rule**.
     - Choose **Custom**, then select **ICMPv4**.
     - Set **Allow the connection**.
     - Make sure the appropriate profiles are selected.
     - Name the rule `Allow ICMP Ping`.

---

### **3. Verify NSG Rules for Private Subnet (SQL-VM)**

Check the **Network Security Group (NSG)** associated with the **private subnet** where your **SQL-VM** resides. This should allow **TCP traffic** to port **1433**.

1. In the **Azure Portal**, go to the **NSG** associated with the **private subnet**.
2. Create an **Inbound Security Rule**:
   - **Source**: **Any** (or a specific IP range if needed).
   - **Source Port Range**: `*`.
   - **Destination**: **Any** (or specify the SQL-VM’s private IP).
   - **Destination Port Range**: `1433`.
   - **Protocol**: **TCP**.
   - **Action**: **Allow**.
   - **Priority**: Make sure the rule has a higher priority (lower number) than any deny rules.
   - **Name**: `Allow-SQL-1433`.

3. **Allow ICMP for Ping (Optional)**:
   - If you want to test connectivity using **ping** (ICMP), add an inbound rule to allow **ICMP** traffic.
   - **Source**: **Any** (or a specific source IP range).
   - **Destination**: **Any**.
   - **Protocol**: **ICMP**.
   - **Action**: **Allow**.
   - **Priority**: Ensure this rule is above any deny rules.
   - **Name**: `Allow-ICMP`.

---

### **4. Verify NSG Rules for Public Subnet (APP-IIS-VM)**

Now, ensure that the **NSG** associated with the **public subnet** (where your **APP-IIS-VM** resides) allows **outbound traffic** to port **1433**.

1. In the **Azure Portal**, go to the **NSG** associated with the **public subnet**.
2. Create an **Outbound Security Rule**:
   - **Source**: **Any** (or a specific IP range if needed).
   - **Source Port Range**: `*`.
   - **Destination**: **Any** (or specify the SQL-VM’s private IP range).
   - **Destination Port Range**: `1433`.
   - **Protocol**: **TCP**.
   - **Action**: **Allow**.
   - **Priority**: Ensure the rule is above any deny rules.
   - **Name**: `Allow-Outbound-SQL-1433`.

3. **Allow ICMP for Ping (Optional)**:
   - If you want **APP-IIS-VM** to respond to **ping** requests, create a rule for **ICMP**:
   - **Source**: **Any** (or specific IP ranges).
   - **Destination**: **Any**.
   - **Protocol**: **ICMP**.
   - **Action**: **Allow**.
   - **Priority**: Ensure this rule is above any deny rules.
   - **Name**: `Allow-ICMP`.

---

### **5. Test the Connection Using SSMS**

After ensuring that SQL Server is properly configured and all firewall/NSG rules are in place, test the connection from **APP-IIS-VM**:

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** on **APP-IIS-VM**.
2. Try connecting to the SQL Server using the **private IP address** of the **SQL-VM** (e.g., `10.0.1.4`).
   - For example, in the **Connect to Server** window, use:
     - **Server Name**: `10.0.1.4,1433` (or just `10.0.1.4` if it's the default port).
     - **Authentication**: SQL Server Authentication (or Windows Authentication if you have the appropriate credentials).
     - **Login**: Your SQL Server login credentials.
     - **Password**: The corresponding password.

3. **Test the Connection**:
   - If you can connect, you should be able to update the **appsettings.json** or **appconfig** file with the correct connection string for SQL Server (using the private IP `10.0.1.4`).

---

### **6. Troubleshooting**

- **Ping Test**: If the ping still fails, ensure that both the **Windows Firewall** and **NSG** rules for ICMP traffic are set up correctly.
- **Telnet**: Use **PowerShell** to test if port 1433 is accessible on SQL-VM:
  ```powershell
  Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.0.1.4 -Port 1433
  ```
- **SQL Server Logs**: If you're still having trouble, check the **SQL Server error logs** for any additional information on why the connection is being rejected.

---

### Summary:

1. **SQL-VM Configuration**: Ensure SQL Server allows remote connections and is listening on port 1433.
2. **Firewall Rules**: Configure Windows Firewall to allow SQL Server on port 1433 and ICMP if needed.
3. **NSG Rules**: Ensure that NSG for **Private Subnet** allows inbound TCP traffic to port 1433 and ICMP for ping. NSG for **Public Subnet** allows outbound traffic to port 1433.
4. **Test Connection**: Test the connection from **APP-IIS-VM** using the private IP (`10.0.1.4`) of **SQL-VM**.

Following these steps should resolve your connectivity issue. Let me know if you encounter any other errors!


It looks like you're trying to test the connection to a remote machine (10.0.1.4) on port 1433 (commonly used for SQL Server) using PowerShell, but the TCP connection test failed. However, the ping test was successful, which indicates that the machine is reachable, but something might be blocking the specific port.

Here are a few potential reasons why this might be happening:

### 1. **Firewall Settings**
   - The firewall on the destination machine (10.0.1.4) could be blocking incoming connections on port 1433.
   - You may want to check the firewall settings on both the client (10.0.0.4) and the server (10.0.1.4) to ensure that port 1433 is open.

   **On the server side (10.0.1.4)**:
   - Check if the firewall allows traffic on port 1433.
     ```powershell
     Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "*SQL*" | Format-Table Name, Enabled
     ```

   - If necessary, open port 1433:
     ```powershell
     New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow SQL Server 1433" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 1433 -Action Allow
     ```

### 2. **SQL Server Configuration**
   - Ensure that the SQL Server on the destination machine is configured to accept remote connections on port 1433.
   - In SQL Server Configuration Manager, check if TCP/IP is enabled for SQL Server and is listening on the correct port (1433).
   - Sometimes, SQL Server is set to listen on dynamic ports, in which case port 1433 may not be the correct one. Check the SQL Server settings for the exact port.

### 3. **Network Issues**
   - Double-check that there are no intermediate devices (like routers or switches) blocking port 1433.
   - Sometimes, specific network configurations or security appliances may restrict certain ports, even if the ping succeeds.

### 4. **Antivirus/Antimalware Software**
   - Certain antivirus or security software can block specific ports, even if the Windows Firewall allows them.

If you can, try connecting from another machine to see if the issue is specific to your machine or network. Also, try accessing SQL Server from a different port (if configured to do so).

Let me know if you'd like more details or troubleshooting steps!

It looks like the firewall rules on both machines (APP_IIS_VM and SQL-VM) are configured to allow SQL Server traffic, but the connection to port 1433 is still failing. Since the ping is successful, the machines are able to communicate, but something is blocking the TCP connection specifically on port 1433.

Let's go through a few additional checks and troubleshooting steps:

### 1. **Check if SQL Server is Listening on Port 1433**
   - On the **SQL-VM** (10.0.1.4), check if SQL Server is actually listening on port 1433. It might be configured to use a different port or only use dynamic ports.

   To do this, run the following command on the SQL Server machine:
   ```powershell
   netstat -an | findstr "1433"
   ```

   If SQL Server is listening on port 1433, you should see something like:
   ```
   TCP    0.0.0.0:1433             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
   ```

   If nothing shows up, then the SQL Server instance may not be listening on port 1433, or it could be using dynamic ports.

### 2. **Check SQL Server Configuration**
   - Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** and navigate to:
     - `SQL Server Network Configuration` -> `Protocols for <Instance Name>`
     - Ensure **TCP/IP** is enabled.
     - Right-click on **TCP/IP** and select **Properties**.
     - Go to the **IP Addresses** tab and check the **IPAll** section. Ensure that the **TCP Dynamic Ports** is blank and **TCP Port** is set to **1433**.

### 3. **Check for Routing or Network Issues**
   - Verify that there are no network issues between the two VMs, especially if they are hosted on different subnets or through a virtual network with restricted routing.

   - Try testing the connection using `telnet` from the **APP_IIS_VM** to the **SQL-VM**:
     ```powershell
     telnet 10.0.1.4 1433
     ```

   If telnet fails, it's an indication that something is blocking the port at the network level.

### 4. **Check Windows Firewall on SQL-VM**
   - Ensure that the firewall on the **SQL-VM** is allowing inbound connections on port 1433.
   - Run the following command to ensure port 1433 is open:
     ```powershell
     Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*SQL*" } | Format-Table Name, Enabled
     ```

   - If needed, open port 1433 on the SQL-VM firewall:
     ```powershell
     New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow SQL Server 1433" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 1433 -Action Allow
     ```

### 5. **Check for Antivirus/Security Software Blocking**
   - Verify if there is any antivirus or third-party security software running on either machine that could be blocking the connection on port 1433. Some security software can block specific ports even when the Windows Firewall rules are correct.

### 6. **Ensure SQL Server is Running**
   - Check if the SQL Server service is running on the **SQL-VM**:
     ```powershell
     Get-Service -Name "MSSQLSERVER"
     ```

   - If it’s not running, start it:
     ```powershell
     Start-Service -Name "MSSQLSERVER"
     ```

### 7. **Test with Different Ports or IP**
   - If possible, test with a different port or IP address to see if the issue is isolated to port 1433. SQL Server might be configured to listen on a different port or bound to a different network interface.

Let me know what you find, and we can continue troubleshooting if needed!

When changing your connection string, the key factor is ensuring that it corresponds to the correct SQL Server instance and network configuration. The two versions you've mentioned have some different ways of specifying the server address, so let's break down the changes you need to consider based on your current setup.

### 1. **Connection String with IP Address (10.0.1.4)**

If you're using the IP address `10.0.1.4` (for example, if you know the SQL Server is hosted at that address), you would typically use the connection string you provided:

```plaintext
data source=10.0.1.4;initial catalog=Vigilante_Master;persist security info=True;User ID=myr;Password=Law14*;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;
```

This approach works if:
- The SQL Server is correctly configured to listen on the IP address `10.0.1.4`.
- Port 1433 (or the port your SQL Server is listening on) is open and accessible from the machine you're connecting from.
- The SQL Server is set to allow remote connections.

### 2. **Connection String with Named Instance (SQL-VM-Private\SQLEXPRESS)**

If you want to connect to a **named instance** like `SQLEXPRESS`, you'll use the server name with the instance name in your connection string. In this case, you would use the following:

```plaintext
data source=SQL-VM-Private\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=Vigilante_Master;persist security info=True;User ID=myr;Password=Law14*;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;
```

This approach works if:
- `SQL-VM-Private` is a valid DNS name or network alias that can resolve to the correct IP address of your SQL Server machine.
- The **SQL Server Express** instance (`SQLEXPRESS`) is running and correctly configured.
- SQL Server is listening on dynamic ports (since named instances can use dynamic ports by default). In this case, you would need to either:
  - Use SQL Server Browser service (for dynamic ports) or,
  - Set SQL Server to listen on a fixed port (e.g., 1433) and update the connection string accordingly.

### What to Change Based on Configuration:

#### Scenario 1: **SQL Server is Listening on a Fixed Port (1433)**

- If SQL Server on the target machine (`10.0.1.4`) is configured to listen on a fixed port (like 1433), and you're confident that port 1433 is open on the server, your connection string using the IP address is correct.

  **Connection string:**
  ```plaintext
  data source=10.0.1.4,1433;initial catalog=Vigilante_Master;persist security info=True;User ID=myr;Password=Law14*;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;
  ```

  Here, the `,1433` specifies the port explicitly. If your server is configured to use a different port, replace `1433` with the correct port.

#### Scenario 2: **SQL Server is Using a Named Instance (SQL-VM-Private\SQLEXPRESS)**

- If SQL Server is configured as a **named instance** (e.g., `SQLEXPRESS`), the instance will not necessarily listen on port 1433. It may be using a dynamic port.
- If you're using the **SQL-VM-Private** server name in your connection string, make sure that DNS or host resolution is working properly between the machines.
- You might need the SQL Server Browser service running on the server to allow the client to discover the correct port for the named instance.

  **Connection string:**
  ```plaintext
  data source=SQL-VM-Private\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=Vigilante_Master;persist security info=True;User ID=myr;Password=Law14*;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;
  ```

  If SQL Server is listening on a dynamic port, ensure that the SQL Server Browser service is running on the SQL-VM to allow the client to automatically find the port. Otherwise, if the port is known, you can specify the port number explicitly in the connection string, like so:

  ```plaintext
  data source=SQL-VM-Private,1433;initial catalog=Vigilante_Master;persist security info=True;User ID=myr;Password=Law14*;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;
  ```

#### Scenario 3: **Testing with Both Connection Strings**

You can test both versions to see which one works for your environment. However, in general, the first one (`10.0.1.4`) should work if:
- The IP is static and correctly mapped.
- The correct firewall settings are applied.
- SQL Server is listening on port 1433.

The second one (`SQL-VM-Private\SQLEXPRESS`) should work if you're using a **named instance** and can ensure the machine resolves `SQL-VM-Private` properly and that SQL Server is configured to accept remote connections (and is running on a dynamic port).

### Conclusion:

- Use `data source=10.0.1.4,1433;` if you're directly accessing the server's IP address and you know SQL Server is listening on port 1433.
- Use `data source=SQL-VM-Private\SQLEXPRESS;` if you're connecting to a named instance, and ensure the **SQL Server Browser service** is enabled for dynamic port resolution.
  
If you continue to encounter issues with the connection, it might be necessary to verify SQL Server's network configuration (e.g., enabling remote connections and specifying the correct port) and ensure there are no network-related blocks.

Awesome! You’ve got your application running on your localhost, but now you want to make it accessible via the **public IP address** of your **APP-IIS VM** on port 8080. Here’s how you can achieve that:

### Steps to Make the Application Accessible on the Public IP:

#### 1. **Ensure IIS Is Configured to Bind to the Correct Port**
   First, check that IIS on your **APP-IIS VM** is set to listen on port 8080 and that it is configured to bind to all network interfaces (including the external one). Here's how you can do that:

   1. Open **IIS Manager** on the **APP-IIS VM**.
   2. In the **Connections** pane, click on **Sites**.
   3. Right-click on your site (or the default site) and select **Edit Bindings**.
   4. In the **Site Bindings** window, check if there's an entry for port `8080`.
      - If not, click **Add** to create a new binding with:
        - **Type**: `http`
        - **IP address**: `All Unassigned` (or the specific private IP address if necessary)
        - **Port**: `8080`
        - **Hostname**: Leave this blank or enter your domain name if you have one.

   5. Click **OK** to save.

#### 2. **Allow Traffic on Port 8080 in the VM’s Firewall**
   Next, ensure that the firewall on the **APP-IIS VM** allows inbound traffic on port 8080.

   Run the following command to add an inbound rule for port 8080:
   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow HTTP on port 8080" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8080 -Action Allow
   ```

#### 3. **Update Network Security Group (NSG) in Azure**
   If your **APP-IIS VM** is running in an **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**, you need to ensure that the **Network Security Group (NSG)** attached to the VM’s network interface allows inbound traffic on port 8080.

   Here’s how to check and update the NSG rules:
   
   1. Go to the **Azure Portal**.
   2. In the left-hand menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
   3. Select your **APP-IIS VM**.
   4. Under **Settings**, click on **Networking**.
   5. Check the **Network Security Group** associated with your VM’s **NIC** or **subnet**.
   6. In the NSG settings, check if there is an inbound rule that allows traffic on port 8080. If not, add the following rule:
      - **Source**: Any (or restrict based on your security requirements)
      - **Source port ranges**: `*`
      - **Destination**: Any
      - **Destination port ranges**: `8080`
      - **Protocol**: TCP
      - **Action**: Allow
      - **Priority**: Give it a high priority number (e.g., 1000)
      - **Name**: `Allow-8080`

   This will ensure that the NSG allows public access to port 8080.

#### 4. **Verify the Application’s External Accessibility**
   After completing the above steps, you should be able to access your application using your **APP-IIS VM's public IP** on port 8080.

   Try accessing your application from a browser:
   ```
   http://74.225.203.80:8080/
   ```
   If everything is set up correctly, you should see your application.

#### 5. **Test Internal Connectivity from the VM**
   - From within the **APP-IIS VM**, try accessing the application via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://<private-ip>:8080` to confirm that IIS is serving the application correctly.
   - You can also check the IIS logs if there are any issues.

#### 6. **Confirm the Public IP is Correct and Available**
   - In case the **public IP** of the VM changes (if it is **dynamic**), ensure you check whether the IP is still the same. If it's **static**, you won’t need to worry about the IP changing.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- **Check IIS Logs**: If the connection still doesn’t work, check the IIS logs for any errors related to binding or network issues. Logs are usually located at:
  ```plaintext
  C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles
  ```

- **Check Azure NSG Rules**: Double-check that the NSG is allowing traffic on port 8080 and that there is no conflicting rule blocking it.

- **Check Firewall and Network Routes**: If your VM has more complex routing (e.g., if it's behind a load balancer or firewall), make sure those network devices are configured to forward traffic to port 8080.

#### Final Checklist:

1. IIS is bound to port 8080.
2. Windows firewall allows traffic on port 8080.
3. NSG allows traffic on port 8080 from the public internet.
4. The public IP of the VM is correctly exposed to the internet.
